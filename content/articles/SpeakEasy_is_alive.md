# SpeakEasy, the AI Bartender: Alive!

This one'll be short and sweet. For the past few weeks I've been consumed by a project to build an AI bot that emulates my favorite kind of experience with a bartender. You know that thing where you're hanging out a schmancy speakeasy style bar and the bartender asks you what you'd like to have, not in terms of a specific cocktail or even liquor, but in terms of flavor profiles? And then just sets to work grabbing one bottle after another until before you know it you've got a little taste of magic in your mouth and you don't even know how? That. That right there is the epitome of mixology, as far as I'm concerned, and that's what I've sought to recreate with my app. Am I done? No, of course not! But I've got a working prototype out and exposed to the world and I'm too excited to keep quiet about it. So [check it out](http://speakeasy-ai-bartender.herokuapp.com/), and check back soon to find a more detailed dive into the nitty-gritty of how it works under the hood and what kinds of plans I've got for the future of SpeakEasy!

This one'll be short and sweet. For the past few weeks I've been consumed by a project to build an AI bot that emulates my favorite kind of experience with a bartender. You know that thing where you're hanging out in a schmancy speakeasy and the bartender asks you what you'd like to haveâ€”not in terms of a specific cocktail, or even liquor, but in terms of the flavor profile? And then just sets to work grabbing one bottle after another until before you know it you've got a little bit of magic in your mouth and you don't even know how? That. That right there is the epitome of mixology, as far as I'm concerned. That's "the speakeasy experience." That's what I've sought to recreate with this app. Am I done? No, of course not! But I've got a working prototype out and exposed to the world and I'm too excited to keep quiet about it. So [check it out](http://speakeasy-ai-bartender.herokuapp.com/), and head on over to [this post](http://scottbutters.com/articles/2019/05/27/Speakeasy-AI-Bartender/) if you want to dive into the nitty-gritty of how it works under the hood and what kinds of plans I've got for the future of SpeakEasy!

Summary: I trained a convolutional neural net to learn a user's aesthetic preferences and select images from a large collection that the user will find to be most beautiful. The model is trained on images from the Space Needle's panoramic camera and uses Xception architecture pre-trained on ImageNet weights. 
Status: published

This is an intro to a project I'll write more about later. For this project, I've trained a convolutional neural net to learn a user's aesthetic preferences and select images from a large collection that the user will find to be most beautiful. The model is trained on images from the Space Needle's panoramic camera and uses Xception architecture pre-trained on ImageNet weights.

# Bits 'n' Bots: Alive?

Welcome to Bits 'n' Bots, the up and coming repo of my thoughts, musings, projects and passions. Here we'll find a incomplete catalog of the off-the-wall topics I obsess over and explore. This blog will be generally data centric and analytical, a site to host and discuss my data science explorations, but from time to time I expect I'll also venture into topics such as futurist ethics, robotics, and really just about anything related to the impending singularity. Thanks for reading and feel free to reach out if any of my work catches your interest!

## About Me

I'm Scott Butters, data scientist and engineer, versed in machine learning, robotics, and the impending singularity (that is, I create bits and bots, and I'm deeply interested in the ways they're becoming more and more infused and entangled in our lives (that is, I'm compelled by issues surrounding complexity, philosophy, and the future (and repetition (and deeply nested parentheses)))).
